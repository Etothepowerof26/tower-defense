# tower_defense
A tower defense gamemode for GMod.

The rewrite branch has the newest version of the tower defense gamemode, as the original version is very scuffed.

### Where do I make custom towers?
Go to sh_td.lua, until I make a towers directory.

### How do I make custom difficulties/rounds?
Go to the rounds folder. This is currently WIP, but rounds are functions that you can use coroutine stuff in. There's already a helper function for waiting in round_sequence_normal.lua
